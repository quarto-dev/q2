//! `cargo xtask create-worktree` — set up a git worktree with beads redirect
//! and a marker-delimited CLAUDE.local.md context section.
//!
//! Three modes (exactly one required):
//!   - positional `<bd-id>` — beads issue (reads `br show`)
//!   - `--issue <N>` — GitHub issue triage (reads `gh issue view`)
//!   - `--upgrade` — cargo dependency upgrade (date-based branch)
//!
//! Filesystem-only: never touches beads state. Skills own beads lifecycle.
