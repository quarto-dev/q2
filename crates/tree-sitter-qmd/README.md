# tree-sitter-qmd

`tree-sitter-qmd` is a fork of [`tree-sitter-markdown`](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown). 
It has a number of non-standard syntax that are used by Quarto in .qmd files specifically.

The original `tree-sitter-markdown` grammar was written by [Matthias Deiml](https://github.com/MDeiml).

`tree-sitter-qmd` is an internal package written entirely to support `quarto-markdown-pandoc`.

For the original tree-sitter-md readme, see [README.tree-sitter-md.md].

For more information on the syntax supported by quarto-markdown, see the top-level docs folder, and specifically the [syntax-nodes.md file](../../docs/syntax-notes.md).
