/**
 * E2E test hooks: expose a couple of internal services on `window` so the
 * Playwright suite can bypass UI to seed projects (`projectStorage`) and
 * render qmd directly (`wasmRenderer`).
 *
 * Why this exists: the E2E suite used to reach into the source tree via
 * `await import('/src/services/...ts')`, which only works under `vite dev`.
 * The CI run uses `vite preview` (production bundle) for throughput; this
 * module is the bridge so the same tests work against the prod bundle.
 *
 * Inclusion is gated on `import.meta.env.VITE_E2E === '1'` at build time
 * (see `src/main.tsx`). Without that flag, vite tree-shakes this module
 * out of the production bundle entirely.
