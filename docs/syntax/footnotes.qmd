## Overview

Footnotes allow you to add references and additional information without cluttering your main text. In `quarto-markdown`, footnotes support both inline and fenced block syntax for definitions, giving you flexibility in how you structure your content.

## Syntax

### Inline Footnote Definitions

The standard Pandoc-style inline syntax uses square brackets with a caret:

```markdown
[^id]: The footnote definition text goes here.
```

This syntax is best for short, single-paragraph footnotes.

### Fenced Block Footnote Definitions

For longer footnotes that contain multiple paragraphs, lists, or other block-level content, use the fenced block syntax:

```markdown
::: ^id
Footnote content goes here.

You can include multiple paragraphs, lists, and other block elements.
:::
```

The fenced block syntax starts with `:::` followed by a space and `^` with the footnote identifier. The content is enclosed between the opening `:::` and closing `:::` markers.

### Footnote References

Reference a footnote in your text using the same `[^id]` syntax:

```markdown
Here is some text with a footnote reference[^1].
```

## Examples

### Basic Inline Footnote

Here is a sentence with a footnote[^basic].

[^basic]: This is a simple inline footnote definition.

```markdown
Here is a sentence with a footnote[^basic].

[^basic]: This is a simple inline footnote definition.
```

### Fenced Block with Single Paragraph

This example demonstrates a simple fenced block footnote[^simple].

::: ^simple
This is a footnote defined using the fenced block syntax. It contains a single paragraph.
:::

```markdown
This example demonstrates a simple fenced block footnote[^simple].

::: ^simple
This is a footnote defined using the fenced block syntax. It contains a single paragraph.
:::
```

### Fenced Block with Multiple Paragraphs

For more detailed footnotes, you can include multiple paragraphs[^multipara].

::: ^multipara
This is the first paragraph of the footnote.

This is the second paragraph, providing additional context or information.

And here's a third paragraph for even more detail.

::: ^multipara

This is the second paragraph, providing additional context or information.

And here's a third paragraph for even more detail.
:::
```

### Fenced Block with Lists

Footnotes can contain complex content like lists[^withlist].

::: ^withlist
This footnote contains a bulleted list:

- First item in the list
- Second item in the list
- Third item in the list

Lists help organize information within footnotes.

### Fenced Block with Inline Formatting

Footnotes support rich inline formatting[^formatted].

::: ^formatted
This footnote has **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`.

It also supports [links](https://example.com) and other inline elements.

### Mixing Inline and Fenced Block Footnotes

You can use both styles in the same document[^inline][^fenced].

[^inline]: This is an inline-style footnote definition.

::: ^fenced
This is a fenced block footnote definition.

It can contain multiple paragraphs and other block-level content.
:::

```markdown

[^inline]: This is an inline-style footnote definition.

::: ^fenced
This is a fenced block footnote definition.

It can contain multiple paragraphs and other block-level content.
:::
```

### Named Footnote Identifiers

Footnote identifiers can be descriptive names, not just numbers[^descriptive-name].

::: ^descriptive-name
Using descriptive names like `^descriptive-name` instead of numbers like `^1` can make your markdown more readable and maintainable.

Identifiers can include letters, numbers, and hyphens.
