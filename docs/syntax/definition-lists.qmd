title: "Definition Lists"
---

## Overview

Definition lists allow you to create term-definition pairs, commonly used for glossaries, dictionaries, or technical documentation. In `quarto-markdown`, definition lists are created using an embedded markdown DSL with divs and bullet lists.

## Syntax

To create a definition list, use a fenced div with the `.definition-list` class containing a bullet list with a specific structure:

```markdown
::: {.definition-list}
* Term 1
  - Definition for term 1
* Term 2
  - First definition for term 2
  - Second definition for term 2
:::
```

### Structure Requirements

Each definition list item must follow this structure:

1. **Top-level bullet item**: Contains the term (as plain text or paragraph)
2. **Nested bullet list**: Contains one or more definitions

The term can include inline formatting like **bold**, *emphasis*, or `code`.

## Examples

### Basic Definition List

::: {.definition-list}
* Quarto
  - An open-source scientific and technical publishing system
* Markdown
  - A lightweight markup language for creating formatted text
* Pandoc
  - A universal document converter
:::

:::

### Multiple Definitions per Term

::: {.definition-list}
* Set
  - A collection of distinct objects
  - In programming, an unordered collection with unique elements
  - In mathematics, a well-defined collection of distinct objects
:::

```markdown

  - A collection of distinct objects
  - In programming, an unordered collection with unique elements
  - In mathematics, a well-defined collection of distinct objects
:::
```

### Terms with Inline Formatting

::: {.definition-list}
* **HTML**
  - HyperText Markup Language, the standard markup language for web pages
* `malloc()`
  - A C function that allocates memory dynamically
* *API*
  - Application Programming Interface
:::

```

## Invalid Syntax

The following patterns will **not** create a definition list and will remain as regular divs:

### Missing Nested List

```markdown
::: {.definition-list}
* Term without definition
* Another term
:::
```

This is invalid because the terms don't have nested bullet lists for definitions.

### Extra Content

```markdown
::: {.definition-list}
* Term

  Extra paragraph here

  - Definition
:::
```

This is invalid because there's additional content (a paragraph) between the term and the definition list.

### Empty Div

```markdown
::: {.definition-list}
:::
```

This is invalid because the div is empty.

## Technical Details

### AST Representation

Definition lists are converted to Pandoc's `DefinitionList` AST node during post-processing. The structure is:

- Each item is a tuple of `(term, definitions)` where:
  - `term` is a list of inline elements
  - `definitions` is a list of definition blocks (each definition is a list of blocks)

### Source Location Preservation

The implementation preserves source location information from the original div, enabling accurate error reporting and source mapping.

### Validation

The parser strictly validates the structure. Invalid definition list divs remain as regular divs with the `.definition-list` class, allowing for graceful degradation and future linting support.

## Comparison with Standard Pandoc Syntax

Standard Pandoc supports definition lists with this syntax:

```markdown
Term 1
: Definition 1

Term 2
: Definition 2a
: Definition 2b
```

`quarto-markdown` currently does **not** support this syntax due to parsing complexity. The embedded div syntax provides an explicit, easy-to-parse alternative that's consistent with other Quarto features like [list tables](https://github.com/pandoc-ext/list-table).

## Future Enhancements

- Linter warnings for invalid definition list structures
- Potential roundtrip support (writing definition lists back to the div syntax)
- Additional styling options via attributes
