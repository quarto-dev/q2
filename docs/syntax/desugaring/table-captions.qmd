title: "Table Caption Attributes"
---

## Overview

Table captions in Quarto Markdown can include attributes after the caption text. Since Pandoc's `Table` node stores caption content separately from table attributes, these caption attributes are extracted and merged into the table's attribute field during post-processing.

## Transformation

When a table caption ends with an `Attr` node:

1. Extract the `Attr` from the end of caption content
2. Merge its key-value pairs into the table's attributes
3. Merge its classes into the table's class list
4. Use its ID if the table doesn't already have one

## Example

### Input QMD

```markdown
| Col 1 | Col 2 |
|-------|-------|
| A     | B     |

: Table caption {#tbl-mytable .special tbl-colwidths="[30,70]"}
```

### Output Structure

The table's `attr` field becomes:

```json
{
  "id": "tbl-mytable",
  "classes": ["special"],
  "attributes": {
    "tbl-colwidths": "[30,70]"
  }
}
```

The caption content no longer includes the `Attr` node - only the text "Table caption" remains.

## Use Cases

### Cross-referencing Tables

```markdown
See @tbl-results for the data.

: Results {#tbl-results}
```

### Column Width Specifications

The `tbl-colwidths` attribute is commonly used to control column widths:

```markdown
: Wide second column {tbl-colwidths="[30,70]"}
```

### Custom Styling

Classes can be used for custom table styling:

```markdown
: Summary table {.striped .bordered}
```
