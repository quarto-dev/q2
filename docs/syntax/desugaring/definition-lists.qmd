title: "Definition Lists"

## Overview

Quarto Markdown supports definition lists through a special div syntax with the `definition-list` class. During post-processing, divs meeting the structural requirements are transformed into Pandoc's native `DefinitionList` blocks.

## Transformation

A div with class `definition-list` containing a specific bullet list structure is converted to a `DefinitionList` block.

### Required Structure

```markdown
::: {.definition-list}
- Term 1
  - Definition 1a
  - Definition 1b
- Term 2
  - Definition 2
:::
```

The structure must follow these rules:

1. Div must have `definition-list` class
2. Div contains exactly one bullet list
3. Each list item has exactly two blocks:
   - First: Plain or Paragraph (the term)
   - Second: BulletList (the definitions)

## Example

### Input QMD

```markdown
::: {.definition-list}
- **Markdown**
  - A lightweight markup language
  - Easy to read and write
- **Pandoc**
  - A universal document converter
:::
```

### Output Structure

Transforms to a `DefinitionList` block:

```json
{
  "t": "DefinitionList",
  "c": [
    [
      [{"t": "Strong", "c": [{"t": "Str", "c": "Markdown"}]}],
      [
        [[{"t": "Plain", "c": [{"t": "Str", "c": "A lightweight markup language"}]}]],
        [[{"t": "Plain", "c": [{"t": "Str", "c": "Easy to read and write"}]}]]
      ]
    ],
    [
      [{"t": "Strong", "c": [{"t": "Str", "c": "Pandoc"}]}],
      [
        [[{"t": "Plain", "c": [{"t": "Str", "c": "A universal document converter"}]}]]
      ]
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Validation

Invalid structures are left as regular divs. Common validation failures:

- Div contains more than one bullet list
- List items don't have exactly two blocks
- First block is not Plain or Paragraph
- Second block is not a BulletList
