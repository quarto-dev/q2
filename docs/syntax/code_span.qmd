title: "Code Spans"

## Overview

Code spans in `quarto-markdown` use a simplified delimiter rule compared to Pandoc. In Pandoc, the number of backticks in the delimiters must differ from any backtick sequence in the content. In `quarto-markdown`, the delimiters must have *more* backticks than any sequence in the content, matching the behavior of code blocks.

## Syntax

Code spans are delimited by backticks:

```markdown
`code`
```

When the content contains backticks, use more backticks in the delimiters:

```markdown
``code with ` backtick``
```

The delimiter must have strictly more backticks than the longest backtick sequence in the content.

## Examples

### Basic Code Span

Use single backticks for simple code:

`variable_name`

```markdown
`variable_name`
```

### Code with Backticks

To include a single backtick in the code, use two backticks as delimiters:

``function(`param`)``

```markdown
``function(`param`)``
```

### Code with Multiple Backticks

For content with two consecutive backticks, use three backticks as delimiters:

```code with `` inside```

```markdown
```code with `` inside```
```

### Code with Three Backticks

For content with three consecutive backticks, use four backticks as delimiters:

````markdown code block: ```js````

```markdown
````markdown code block: ```js````
```

## Difference from Pandoc

In Pandoc, you could use delimiters with a *different* count from the content:

- Pandoc allows: ```` `` ``` `` ```` to represent triple backticks (1 backtick differs from 3)
- Pandoc allows: ````` ```` ` ```` ````` to represent a single backtick (4 backticks differs from 1)

In `quarto-markdown`, the delimiter count must be *greater*:

- To represent `` ` ``, use at least ``` `` ```
- To represent ``` `` ```, use at least ```` ``` ````
- To represent ```` ``` ````, use at least ````` ```` `````

This matches the fenced code block rule: three backticks can contain up to two backticks, four can contain up to three, and so on.

## Limitations

- Delimiter backticks must strictly exceed the content's longest backtick sequence
- Unlike Pandoc, you cannot use fewer delimiters just because the count differs
