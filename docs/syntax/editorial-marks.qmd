title: "Editorial Marks"
---

## Overview

Editorial marks allow you to annotate your text with suggestions, highlights, and comments during the editing and review process. In `quarto-markdown`, these marks use a special bracket syntax and are converted to Pandoc AST spans with specific CSS classes that can be styled or processed by filters.

## Syntax

Editorial marks use a square bracket syntax with special marker characters:

- `[!! text]` - Highlight
- `[++ text]` - Insertion suggestion
- `[-- text]` - Deletion suggestion
- `[>> text]` - Comment

The opening bracket is followed by two marker characters, then a space, and then the content to be marked. The mark is closed with a closing bracket.

Editorial marks can also include attributes (IDs, classes, and key-value pairs) immediately after the closing bracket, like spans: `[!! text]{#my-id}`, `[++ text]{.my-class}`, etc.

## Examples

### Highlight

Use `[!! text]` to highlight important sections that need attention:

This paragraph contains [!! an important section] that should be reviewed.

```markdown
This paragraph contains [!! an important section] that should be reviewed.
```

### Insertion Suggestion

Use `[++ text]` to suggest text that should be added:

The document needs [++ additional context here] to be complete.

```markdown
The document needs [++ additional context here] to be complete.
```

### Deletion Suggestion

Use `[-- text]` to suggest text that should be removed:

This sentence has [-- unnecessary] words that can be deleted.

```markdown
This sentence has [-- unnecessary] words that can be deleted.
```

### Comment

Use `[>> text]` to add editorial comments or notes:

The conclusion [>> needs more supporting evidence] requires revision.

```markdown
The conclusion [>> needs more supporting evidence] requires revision.
```

### Multiple Marks in One Paragraph

You can use multiple editorial marks in a single paragraph:

This paragraph has [!! a highlight], [++ an insertion], [-- a deletion], and [>> a comment] all together.

```markdown
This paragraph has [!! a highlight], [++ an insertion], [-- a deletion], and [>> a comment] all together.
```

### Nested Formatting

Editorial marks can contain other inline formatting:

The section needs [++ **bold text** and *italic text*] to emphasize the point.

```markdown
The section needs [++ **bold text** and *italic text*] to emphasize the point.
```

## Use Cases

Editorial marks are particularly useful for:

- **Collaborative editing**: Team members can suggest changes without directly modifying the text
- **Review workflows**: Reviewers can highlight issues and suggest improvements
- **Track changes**: Similar to word processor track changes, but in plain text
- **Editorial comments**: Editors can leave notes without disrupting the flow of the document

## Limitations

- Editorial marks only support inline content, not block-level elements
- The marker characters (`!!`, `++`, `--`, `>>`) must be followed by a space
- Editorial marks cannot be nested within each other
