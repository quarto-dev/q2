## Overview

Lists in `quarto-markdown` support both bullet (unordered) and ordered lists with standard Markdown syntax. However, empty list items require special syntax due to a parser limitation.

## Syntax

### Bullet Lists

Bullet lists use `*`, `-`, or `+` as markers:

```markdown
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
```

### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists use numbers followed by `.` or `)`:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### Nested Lists

Lists can be nested by indenting:

```markdown
* Top level
  * Nested item
  * Another nested item
* Back to top level
```

## Empty List Items

### The Limitation

Unlike some Markdown parsers, `quarto-markdown` cannot parse truly empty list items with just a bullet marker:

```markdown
* Item with content
*
* Another item
```

The empty marker on the second line will cause a parse error.

### The Workaround

To create an empty list item, use square brackets `[]` after the bullet:

* Item with content
* []
* Another item

```markdown
* Item with content
* []
* Another item
```

The `[]` syntax creates an empty span that is removed during processing, resulting in a genuinely empty list item in the AST while maintaining Pandoc AST compatibility.

## Examples

### Mixed Content and Empty Items

* First item with text
* []
* Third item with more text
* []

```markdown
* First item with text
* []
* Third item with more text
* []
```

### Empty Items in Nested Lists

* Top level item
  * Nested item
  * []
  * Another nested item
* []

```markdown
* Top level item
  * Nested item
  * []
  * Another nested item
* []
```

## Technical Details

### AST Representation

The `[]` syntax is parsed as an empty span, which is then removed during post-processing. The result is a list item containing a block with no inline content, matching Pandoc's representation of empty list items.

### Roundtripping

Documents are written back with `* []` for empty items, ensuring that:

1. The syntax is preserved through parse → AST → write cycles
2. The AST contains truly empty list items (no span)
3. The document remains valid `quarto-markdown`

## Limitations

- Empty list items require the `[]` syntax (`[]{}` is also supported, but is written back out as `[]`); a bare bullet marker is invalid
- The `[]` must be empty (no spaces or content inside)
- This applies to both bullet and ordered lists
