title: "Syntax Extensions"
---

This section documents syntax extensions and features specific to `quarto-markdown`.

## Work in Progress

The features documented here are currently under development. The syntax and behavior may change as we refine the implementation.

## Available Features

- [Code Spans](code_span.qmd) - Code span delimiters require more backticks than content (differs from Pandoc)
- [Definition Lists](definition-lists.qmd) - Create definition lists using an embedded markdown DSL
- [Editorial Marks](editorial-marks.qmd) - Annotate text with highlights, insertions, deletions, and comments
- [Footnotes](footnotes.qmd) - Add footnotes with inline or fenced block syntax
- [YAML Metadata](yaml-metadata.qmd) - Control markdown parsing in metadata with YAML tags

## Advanced Topics

- [AST Desugaring](desugaring/index.qmd) - How extended syntax constructs are transformed into standard Pandoc AST nodes
