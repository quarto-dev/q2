Quarto Hub supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit the same project simultaneously.

## How It Works

Quarto Hub uses [Automerge](https://automerge.org/), a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) library, to synchronize changes between collaborators.

### Key Concepts

- **Real-time sync**: Changes propagate to all connected users within seconds
- **Conflict-free**: Multiple users can edit simultaneously without conflicts
- **Offline support**: Edits made offline sync when you reconnect
- **No central server required**: Sync can work peer-to-peer (though a relay server helps with connectivity)

## Sharing a Project

### Share Dialog

1. Click the **Share** button in the toolbar
2. Copy the generated sharing URL
3. Send the URL to your collaborators

### Sharing URL

The sharing URL contains a project identifier that connects collaborators to the same document. Anyone with the URL can access and edit the project.

## Security Consideration

The sharing URL grants full edit access to anyone who has it. Only share URLs with people you trust, and consider the URL as sensitive as a password.

Currently, there is no read-only sharing mode or access control. These features may be added in future releases.

## Collaborating

### Joining a Shared Project

1. Click the sharing URL you received
2. Quarto Hub opens with the shared project
3. You can immediately start editing

### Seeing Others' Changes

When collaborators make changes:

- The document updates automatically
- The preview re-renders to show the new content
- There's no need to refresh or manually sync

### Presence (Coming Soon)

Future versions may show:

- Who else is currently viewing the project
- Where each collaborator's cursor is located
- Which file each person is editing

## Sync Server

### Default Server

Quarto Hub connects to a default sync server that relays changes between collaborators. This server:

- Facilitates connections between browsers
- Temporarily stores changes for offline users
- Does not permanently store your document content

### Self-Hosting

For organizations that need more control, the sync server can be self-hosted. Configuration details are available in the technical documentation.

## Best Practices

### Coordination

Even with real-time sync, it helps to coordinate with collaborators:

- Communicate about who's editing which sections
- Use comments or callouts to mark work-in-progress areas
- Check in regularly to avoid duplicated effort

### Backup

While Automerge is designed for reliability, it's good practice to:

- Export important projects periodically
- Keep copies of critical documents outside Quarto Hub
- Don't rely solely on browser storage for important work

## Limitations

Current prototype limitations:

- **No access control**: Anyone with the URL has full edit access
- **No presence indicators**: You can't see who else is online
- **No change history**: There's no undo for others' changes or version history
- **No comments**: Inline commenting is not yet available

These features may be added in future releases.

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Syncing

If changes aren't appearing for collaborators:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify everyone is using the same sharing URL

### Conflicting Edits

Automerge handles most conflicts automatically. If you see unexpected content:

1. Don't panic - no data is lost
2. Review the merged content
3. Make any necessary corrections
4. Changes will sync to all collaborators
