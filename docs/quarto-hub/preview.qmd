Quarto Hub renders your documents in real-time, showing you exactly how they will look as you write.

## Real-Time Rendering

The preview panel updates automatically as you type. There's a brief delay (debouncing) to avoid excessive re-renders while you're actively editing.

### How It Works

1. You edit the document in the Monaco editor
2. After a short pause in typing, the content is sent to the WASM rendering engine
3. The engine parses the Quarto markdown and generates HTML
4. The preview panel displays the rendered result

All rendering happens locally in your browser - no server round-trip is required.

## Preview Panel

The preview panel shows your rendered document with full styling:

- **Bootstrap CSS** provides the base styling
- **Bootswatch themes** can customize the appearance
- **Custom SCSS** allows further customization

### Resizing

Drag the divider between the editor and preview to adjust their relative sizes.

## Scroll Synchronization

The editor and preview panels stay synchronized as you navigate:

- **Scrolling the editor** scrolls the preview to show the corresponding content
- **Clicking in the preview** moves the editor cursor to that location

This makes it easy to work on specific sections of long documents.

## Error Display

When your document contains syntax errors, the preview panel shows helpful diagnostics:

### Error Overlay

Parse errors display in an overlay with:

- **Error message** describing the problem
- **Line and column** where the error occurred
- **Code snippet** showing the problematic area

### Editor Markers

Errors also appear as red squiggly underlines in the editor, similar to a code IDE. Hover over the underline to see the error message.

### Warning Indicators

Warnings (non-fatal issues) appear as yellow underlines and don't prevent rendering.

## Document Outline

The outline panel (accessible via the sidebar tabs) shows the structure of your document:

- **Headings** are listed hierarchically
- **Click** a heading to jump to that section
- **Collapsible sections** for nested heading structures

The outline updates automatically as you edit.

## Supported Content

The preview renders most Quarto markdown features:

- Headings, paragraphs, and text formatting
- Lists (ordered, unordered, and definition lists)
- Links and images
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables
- Block quotes and callouts
- Mathematical notation (LaTeX)
- Footnotes

### Limitations

Some features that work in full Quarto are not yet supported in Quarto Hub:

- Code execution (Python, R, etc.)
- Cross-references
- Citations and bibliographies
- Some advanced layout features

These limitations exist because Quarto Hub runs entirely in the browser without access to external compute engines.

## Performance

Rendering performance depends on document complexity:

- **Simple documents** render nearly instantly
- **Large documents** with many elements may take a moment
- **Complex math** can slow rendering slightly

The debounce delay helps maintain smooth editing even with slower renders.
