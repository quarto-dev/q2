File templates allow you to create reusable starting points for new documents. When templates are available, they appear in the New File dialog's dropdown menu.

## What Are Templates?

Templates are regular `.qmd` files stored in a special directory. When you create a new file and select a template, the new file is pre-populated with the template's content.

This is useful for:

- Maintaining consistent document structure across a project
- Pre-filling common frontmatter options
- Including boilerplate content that every document needs

## Creating Templates

### Template Directory

Create a directory called `_quarto-hub-templates` at the root of your project:

```
my-project/
  _quarto-hub-templates/
    article.qmd
    report.qmd
    presentation.qmd
  _quarto.yml
  index.qmd
```

### Template Files

Each `.qmd` file in this directory becomes a template. Create a template by adding a file with the content you want new documents to start with.

### Template Name

Add a `template-name` field to your template's frontmatter to give it a display name:

```yaml
---
template-name: "Research Article"
title: "Untitled Article"
author: ""
date: today
format: html
---

# Introduction

Start your introduction here.

# Methods

Describe your methods.

# Results

Present your findings.

# Discussion

Discuss the implications.
```

When this template is used, the `template-name` field is automatically removed from the new file - only the actual document content is copied.

### Filename Fallback

If you don't include a `template-name`, the filename (without extension) is used as the display name. For example, `quick-note.qmd` would appear as "quick-note" in the dropdown.

## Using Templates

1. Click **+ New** to open the New File dialog
2. In the **New Text File** tab, select a template from the **Template** dropdown
3. Enter a filename for your new document
4. Click **Create**

The new file will be created with the template's content (minus the `template-name` field).

## Example Templates

### Article Template

```yaml
---
template-name: "Article"
title: "Untitled"
author: ""
format:
  html:
    toc: true
---

# Introduction

# Main Content

# Conclusion
```

### Meeting Notes Template

```yaml
---
template-name: "Meeting Notes"
title: "Meeting Notes"
date: today
---

## Attendees

-

## Agenda

1.

## Discussion

## Action Items

- [ ]
```

### Blog Post Template

```yaml
---
template-name: "Blog Post"
title: "Post Title"
author: "Your Name"
date: today
categories: []
format:
  html:
    toc: true
---

Write your introduction here.

## Section 1

## Section 2

## Conclusion
```

## Organization

### Top-Level Only

Only `.qmd` files directly in `_quarto-hub-templates/` are recognized as templates. Files in subdirectories are ignored:

```
_quarto-hub-templates/
  article.qmd          # Recognized as template
  report.qmd           # Recognized as template
  drafts/              # Subdirectory ignored
    old-template.qmd   # NOT a template
```

### Visibility

The `_quarto-hub-templates` directory is visible in the file sidebar. This makes it easy to edit and manage your templates directly in Quarto Hub.

## Tips

- **Keep templates focused**: Create multiple specific templates rather than one complex template
- **Use meaningful names**: The `template-name` appears in the dropdown, so make it descriptive
- **Include placeholders**: Add empty sections or placeholder text to guide document authors
- **Set smart defaults**: Pre-fill frontmatter options that rarely change
