Quarto Hub provides a complete file management system for organizing your project files directly in the browser.

## File Sidebar

The file sidebar on the left shows all files in your project. Click on any file to open it in the editor.

### Navigation

- **Click** a file to open it
- **Folders** can be expanded and collapsed by clicking the arrow
- Files are organized alphabetically within each folder

### File Icons

Different file types display with distinct icons:

- `.qmd` files show a Quarto icon
- Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) show an image icon
- Other files show a generic document icon

## Creating New Files

Click the **+ New** button in the toolbar to open the New File dialog.

### New Text File

1. Select the **New Text File** tab
2. If templates are available, choose one from the **Template** dropdown (or leave as "Blank file")
3. Enter a filename (e.g., `chapter-2.qmd`)
4. Click **Create**

The file will be created in the current directory and opened in the editor.

### Upload File

1. Select the **Upload File** tab
2. Either:
   - **Drag and drop** files onto the drop zone
   - Click **Browse Files** to select files from your computer
3. Click **Upload**

Supported upload types include images (PNG, JPG, SVG) and PDFs.

## File Organization

### Creating Folders

To create a file in a new folder, include the folder path in the filename:

```
images/diagram.png
chapters/introduction.qmd
```

The folder will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

### Moving and Renaming

File moving and renaming are not yet supported in the UI. This functionality is planned for a future release.

## Supported File Types

### Editable Text Files

These files can be opened and edited in the Monaco editor:

- `.qmd` - Quarto markdown (with live preview)
- `.md` - Markdown
- `.yml`, `.yaml` - YAML configuration
- `.css`, `.scss` - Stylesheets
- `.html` - HTML files
- `.js`, `.ts` - JavaScript/TypeScript
- `.json` - JSON data

### Binary Files

These files can be uploaded and used in documents but cannot be edited:

- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif` - Images
- `.svg` - Vector graphics
- `.pdf` - PDF documents

## Special Directories

### `_quarto-hub-templates/`

This directory holds [file templates](templates.qmd). Template files are `.qmd` files that appear in the New File dialog's template dropdown.

### `_quarto.yml`

The project configuration file. This file defines project-wide settings like the project type and default format options.
