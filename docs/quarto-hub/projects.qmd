Quarto Hub organizes your work into projects. Each project is a self-contained collection of files that can be edited, previewed, and shared.

## Creating a Project

When you first open Quarto Hub or click **New Project**, you'll see the project creation dialog.

### Project Types

Choose from available project types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Default** | A simple project with a single `index.qmd` document |
| **Website** | A multi-page website with navigation and `_quarto.yml` configuration |

### Project Title

Enter a title for your project. This appears in the toolbar and is used when sharing.

### What Gets Created

When you create a project, Quarto Hub generates starter files appropriate for the project type:

**Default project:**
```
index.qmd
```

**Website project:**
```
_quarto.yml
index.qmd
about.qmd
```

## Project Configuration

### `_quarto.yml`

The `_quarto.yml` file contains project-wide configuration:

```yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "My Project"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
```

This file controls:

- Project type
- Website navigation
- Default format options
- Theme settings

### Editing Configuration

Click on `_quarto.yml` in the file sidebar to edit it. Changes take effect on the next render.

## Opening Projects

### From URL

Projects can be opened directly via URL. If someone shares a project link with you, clicking it will open that project in Quarto Hub.

### Local Storage

Quarto Hub stores your projects in the browser's local storage. When you return to Quarto Hub, your recent projects are available.

::: {.callout-note}
Browser local storage is limited and specific to your device and browser. For persistent, cross-device access, use the sharing features.

## Project Files

### Adding Files

Use the **+ New** button to add files to your project. See [File Management](files.qmd) for details.

### File Structure

Organize your project files however makes sense for your content:

```
my-website/
  _quarto.yml
  index.qmd
  about.qmd
  posts/
    first-post.qmd
    second-post.qmd
  images/
    logo.png
    diagram.svg
  styles/
    custom.scss
```

### Special Files

Some files have special meaning in Quarto projects:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_quarto.yml` | Project configuration |
| `index.qmd` | Default landing page |
| `_quarto-hub-templates/` | File templates directory |

## Limitations

Current prototype limitations:

- **No project import/export**: Projects exist only in browser storage or via sync
- **No Git integration**: Version control is not available
- **Single project view**: You can only have one project open at a time

These features may be added in future releases.
