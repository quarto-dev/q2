Quarto Hub supports theme customization through Bootswatch themes and custom SCSS files.

## Default Theme

By default, documents render with the standard Bootstrap theme. This provides clean, readable styling suitable for most documents.

## Bootswatch Themes

[Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) provides a collection of free themes for Bootstrap. You can apply any Bootswatch theme by specifying it in your document's frontmatter.

### Using a Theme

Add a `theme` option to your document's YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
---
```

### Available Themes

Quarto Hub includes all standard Bootswatch themes:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `default` | Standard Bootstrap |
| `cerulean` | Calm blue sky |
| `cosmo` | Extra harmony (default for Quarto) |
| `cyborg` | Dark with neon accents |
| `darkly` | Flatly in night mode |
| `flatly` | Flat and clean |
| `journal` | Crisp like a newspaper |
| `litera` | Literary inspiration |
| `lumen` | Light and shadow |
| `lux` | Luxury styling |
| `materia` | Material design inspired |
| `minty` | Fresh mint flavor |
| `morph` | Soft neumorphism |
| `pulse` | Vibrant and fun |
| `quartz` | Glass-like design |
| `sandstone` | Warm and soft |
| `simplex` | Mini and simple |
| `sketchy` | Hand-drawn look |
| `slate` | Shades of gray |
| `solar` | Spin on Solarized |
| `spacelab` | Silvery and sleek |
| `superhero` | Bold and heroic |
| `united` | Ubuntu orange |
| `vapor` | Cyberpunk vibes |
| `yeti` | Friendly and soft |
| `zephyr` | Breezy and light |

## Custom SCSS

For more control, you can create custom SCSS files that extend or override theme styles.

### Creating a Custom Theme

1. Create an SCSS file in your project (e.g., `custom.scss`)
2. Reference it in your frontmatter along with a base theme:

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format:
  html:
    theme:
      - cosmo
      - custom.scss
---
```

### SCSS Variables

Your custom SCSS can override Bootstrap and Bootswatch variables:

```scss
// custom.scss

// Override primary color
$primary: #8B5CF6;

// Override font family
$font-family-base: "Georgia", serif;

// Override heading styles
$headings-font-weight: 600;
```

### Adding Custom Styles

You can also add entirely new CSS rules:

```scss
// custom.scss

// Style callout blocks
.callout {
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

// Custom heading underlines
h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid $primary;
  padding-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Theme Layering

When you specify multiple themes, they are applied in order:

```yaml
theme:
  - cosmo        # Base theme
  - brand.scss   # Brand colors
  - custom.scss  # Additional customizations
```

Later files override earlier ones, so put your most specific customizations last.

## Theme Caching

Quarto Hub caches compiled CSS to improve performance. The cache is automatically invalidated when:

- You modify your custom SCSS files
- The built-in SCSS resources are updated

If you're seeing stale styles, try refreshing the page.

## Limitations

Some theme features available in full Quarto are not yet supported:

- Theme `light` and `dark` mode switching
- Some advanced SCSS functions
- Theme preview without page reload

These features may be added in future releases.
