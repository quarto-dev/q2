# Beads - AI-Native Issue Tracking

Welcome to Beads! This repository uses **Beads** for issue tracking - a modern, AI-native tool designed to live directly in your codebase alongside your code.

## What is Beads?

Beads is issue tracking that lives in your repo, making it perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want their issues close to their code. No web UI required - everything works through the CLI and integrates seamlessly with git.

## Quick Start

**Note:** `br` is non-invasive and never executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues
br create "Add user authentication"

# View all issues
br list

# View issue details
br show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
br update <issue-id> --status in_progress
br update <issue-id> --status done

# Sync and commit
br sync --flush-only
git add .beads/
git commit -m "sync beads"
```

### Working with Issues

Issues in Beads are:
- **Git-native**: Stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and synced like code
- **AI-friendly**: CLI-first design works perfectly with AI coding agents
- **Branch-aware**: Issues can follow your branch workflow

## Why Beads?
