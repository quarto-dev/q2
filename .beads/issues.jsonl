Modify external scanner to terminate pipe tables when next line starts with ': ' (single colon for caption, not '::' for fenced div)\n\nSee detailed plan: claude-notes/plans/2025-10-27-table-caption-blank-line-fix.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-24T18:53:14.564757Z","updated_at":"2025-10-27T17:39:58.876960Z","closed_at":"2025-10-27T17:39:58.876960Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"k-185","depends_on_id":"k-184","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2026-02-10T21:35:30Z","created_by":"import","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}

{"id":"k-481","title":"quarto.warn/error element location doesn't work for original document elements","description":"## Problem\n\nThe `quarto.warn(msg, elem)` and `quarto.error(msg, elem)` functions accept an optional AST element to attach source location information. However, this only works for elements **created by filters** (which have `FilterProvenance` source info), not elements **from the original document** (which have `SourceInfo::Original`).\n\nThis is a significant limitation because user-provided filters that want to act as linters cannot report warnings/errors about specific locations in the source document - they can only report the filter's own location.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `src/lua/diagnostics.rs`, the `source_info_to_path_line` function (lines 208-218) only handles `FilterProvenance`:\n\n```rust\nfn source_info_to_path_line(source_info: &SourceInfo) -> Option<(String, i64)> {\n    match source_info {\n        SourceInfo::FilterProvenance { filter_path, line } => {\n            Some((filter_path.clone(), *line as i64))\n        }\n        // For Original source info, we don't have easy access to the filename\n        // without a SourceContext. For now, return None to fall back to stack.\n        _ => None,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor `SourceInfo::Original`, we need access to `SourceContext` to:\n1. Look up the `FileId` to get the filename\n2. Map byte offsets to line/column numbers\n\nThe `SourceContext` is available in `ASTContext` but is not currently passed to the Lua diagnostic functions.\n\n## How to Test\n\nCreate a test filter `linter.lua`:\n```lua\nfunction Str(elem)\n    if elem.text:match('TODO') then\n        quarto.warn('Found TODO in document', elem)\n    end\n    return elem\nend\n```\n\nCreate a test document `test.qmd`:\n```markdown\nThis has a TODO item.\n```\n\nRun:\n```bash\ncargo run -- -L linter.lua -i test.qmd -t native\n```\n\n**Expected**: Warning shows location in `test.qmd` (line 1, around column 12)\n**Actual**: Warning shows location in `linter.lua` (line 3, the quarto.warn call)\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Pass ASTContext to Lua state**: Store `ASTContext` (or at least `SourceContext`) in the Lua registry so diagnostic functions can access it\n2. **Thread-local context**: Use a thread-local to store context during filter execution\n3. **Closure capture**: Capture context in the Lua function closures created in `register_quarto_namespace`\n\nOption 1 or 3 seems cleanest. The context would need to be set before filter execution and cleared after.\n\n## Related\n\n- Parent issue: k-480 (Implement quarto.warn/error Lua functions)\n- Plan: claude-notes/plans/2025-12-03-lua-filter-diagnostics-implementation.md\n- Discussion: Element location extraction was identified as incomplete during implementation review","notes":"Plan document: claude-notes/plans/2025-12-03-k481-source-location-resolution.md\n\nFINAL APPROACH: Store SourceInfo as Lua table (not userdata)\n\nWhy not userdata?\n- In Pandoc, userdata = AST nodes. Filters may use type(x)=='userdata' to identify elements.\n- Using userdata for non-AST data could cause Pandoc compatibility issues.\n\nWhy not thread-local IDs?  \n- If diagnostic entries are serialized, IDs become meaningless.\n\nSolution: Serialize SourceInfo to plain Lua table, deserialize on extraction.\n\nLua table format:\n  { t = 'Original', file_id = 0, start_offset = 42, end_offset = 55 }\n  { t = 'Substring', parent = {...}, start_offset = 10, end_offset = 20 }\n  { t = 'FilterProvenance', filter_path = '...', line = 42 }\n\nChanges needed in diagnostics.rs:\n1. Add source_info_to_lua_table() and source_info_from_lua_table()\n2. Update add_diagnostic() to store serialized SourceInfo\n3. Update extract_lua_diagnostics() to deserialize and pass to builder\n4.
