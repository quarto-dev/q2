# Introduction

Climate prediction is a critical challenge in modern science^[See @ipcc2021 for comprehensive discussion]. Traditional statistical methods have limitations when dealing with complex, non-linear relationships in climate data.

## Background

The field of climate science has evolved significantly over the past decades [@doe2020; @smith2019]. Recent advances in computational power enable new approaches.

# Methods

## Data Collection

We collected data from three sources:

| Source | Years | Variables |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Station A | 1990-2020 | Temp, Precip |
| Station B | 1995-2020 | Temp, Wind |
| Satellite | 2000-2020 | All |

## Model Architecture

Our model uses a transformer architecture with attention mechanisms. The loss function is defined as:

$$
L(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

where $\theta$ represents model parameters and $N$ is the sample size.

# Results

## Performance Metrics

The model achieved significant improvements:

- RMSE: 0.45 (baseline: 0.78)
- $R^2$: 0.92 (baseline: 0.65)
- MAE: 0.31 (baseline: 0.58)

See @tbl-data for data sources used in training.

# Discussion

Our results demonstrate that machine learning methods can effectively capture complex patterns in climate data. However, several limitations remain^[Further work is needed to address regional variations].

## Limitations

The current study focuses on temperature prediction. Future work should extend to:

1. Precipitation patterns
2. Extreme weather events
3. Long-term trends

# Conclusion

Machine learning offers promising approaches to climate prediction. The techniques presented here provide a foundation for future research in this critical domain [@johnson2021].
